			<br>
			<div class="note">What's my major?</div>
			Computer science
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="note">When do I graduate?</div>
			I'm graduating this May!
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="note">What projects have I done outside of school?</div>
			I've done a lot of projects in the span of my time at KU outside of classes. <br>
			I've made a globally ranked Artificial Intelligence Bot, I've competed in  <br>
			several code-a-thons, I've taken my own time to research Universal Algebra <br>
			and algorithms, launched my own AWS website, and a lot more. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="note">Are there any projects you're currently working on now?</div>
			Yea. Honestly I'm always working on projects. The project that I'm currently <br>
			studying now is the Vigenere cipher once again since I made a breakthrough in <br>
			it's complexity.
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="note">Favorite language?</div>
			My favorite language is python but almost every programming language has some  <br>
			part of it that I like a lot and I've had to learn so many that I'm more than  <br>
			confident it wouldn't take me more than a weekend to learn anything I've never <br>
			seen before(not to brag).
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="note">Second favorite language?</div>
			MIPs would probably have to be my second favorite language. It's always a new <br>
			challenge and having such a large restriction as to only allow two arguments <br>
			every line is very fun. Plus I have a few programming games that require MIPs <br>
			that are really fun.
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="note">Are you in any clubs?</div>
			Yes! I regularly attend swing dancing and have been doing so for five years.<br>
			It's some of the most fun I've had at college. Of course I've also been<br>
			involved in more curricular minded clubs such as ACM, the Artificial Intelligence<br>
			club, the Game Developers Association, the Web Developement Club, and KU <br>
			Women In Computing.I also was did marching band, volleyball band, and was in <br>
			the KU symphonic band for two years.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="note">What was your role in these clubs?</div>
			<li>
			As the President of the Game Developers Association at KU I officially ran the<br>
			club and taught many students how games are made and how to think in an<br>
			object oriented manner to make game developement easier.<br>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			As the secretary of the Web Developement Club I was in charge of helping run<br>
			and plan for upcoming meetings.<br>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			As the treasurer of the artificial intelligence club I kept track of our budget<br>
			and was in charge of keeping in contact with the student senate for funding<br>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			As a member of the KU women in computing I attended a code-a-thon and built a<br>
			web application around the Pinterest API.<br>
			</li>
